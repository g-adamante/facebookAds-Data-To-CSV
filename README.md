# facebookAds-Data-To-CSV
This script was used to extract data from Facebook's Marketing API. 

### Don't use this code
Frankly, It's a mess. It was one of the first scripts I've ever written and It's not doing a lot of things right.

I'm going to keep it here because I know some people get to it while searching for this specific use case, but **If you need to extract data from the Facebook Marketing API, you should use the Singer tap made for that.** 

Take a look at [Tap-facebook](https://github.com/singer-io/tap-facebook) and [Target-csv](https://github.com/singer-io/target-csv).
